# Tower of Vertigo

Tower of Vertigo is a fast paced action game that mixes the platformer genre with fighting game mechanics. Players must clash in a life or death race with the objective  of capturing the orb at the top.
Each player must face the vertiginous map, its obstacles and their rival.
Only the player that masters combat and map mobility will achieve victory. 

This is a game (still in development) developed by students from <a href="https://www.imagecampus.edu.ar/">Image Campus</a>
